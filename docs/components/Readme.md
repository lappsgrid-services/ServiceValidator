# Checking services

This directory contains the result of various checks on a series of services. Much of it is done on a small [sample file](karen_flies.tcxt) with minimal content that still contains enough richness so services should actually produce some output. The services used are either from the LAPPS/Galaxy page at http://galaxy.lappsgrid.org/ or the one at http://jetstream.lappsgrid.org.

The following services were tested or will be tested:

- [Sentence Splitters](splitters.md)
- [Tokenizers](tokenizers.md)
- [POS Taggers](taggers.md)
- [Chunkers](chunkers.md)
- Named Entity Recognizers
- Coreference Tools
- Phrase Structure Parsers
- Dependency Structure Parsers
